                <h1>Missile Man Of India</h1>
                <p>Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, fondly remembered as the “Missile Man of India” and the “People’s President”, was one of the most inspiring leaders of modern India. Born in Rameswaram in 1931, he rose from humble beginnings to become a renowned scientist, playing a key role in India’s space and missile development programs, including the successful Pokhran-II nuclear tests. Known for his simplicity, humility, and dedication to education and youth, he served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007 and won the love of millions through his vision for a developed India. Beyond his scientific achievements, Dr. Kalam was a teacher at heart, encouraging students to dream big and work hard with integrity. His life continues to motivate generations to pursue knowledge, innovation, and service to the nation.
